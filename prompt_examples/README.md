- Procedure descriptions

**Use Cases:**
- Course material development
- Student training and assessment
- Medical teaching scenarios

### 4. Patient Communication (`patient_communication.md`)
Prompts for:
- Explaining diagnoses in simple terms
- Medication instructions
- Lifestyle counseling
- Breaking bad news

**Use Cases:**
- Patient education material creation
- Health literacy improvement
- Communication skills training

## How to Use These Prompts

### 1. Understand the Context
- Each prompt includes context about the patient or scenario
- Pay attention to specific details provided
- Consider what information is most relevant

### 2. Customize for Your Needs
- Modify age, gender, symptoms as needed
- Adjust complexity based on audience
- Add specific constraints or requirements

### 3. Iterate and Refine
- Start with the basic prompt
- Add more specific details if needed
- Refine based on the quality of responses

### 4. Consider Limitations
- AI responses are for educational purposes
- Always verify medical information
- Do not use for actual patient care without professional oversight

## Best Practices for Healthcare Prompts

### 1. Be Specific
```
❌ Bad: "Tell me about diabetes"
✅ Good: "Explain Type 2 diabetes management to a 55-year-old newly diagnosed patient with limited health literacy"
```

### 2. Provide Context
```
❌ Bad: "What medication should I prescribe?"
✅ Good: "For a 60-year-old male with newly diagnosed hypertension (BP 155/98), no other comorbidities, what first-line antihypertensive would you recommend and why?"
```

### 3. Specify the Output Format
```
❌ Bad: "Analyze these lab results"
✅ Good: "Interpret these lab results and provide: 1) Assessment, 2) Differential diagnosis, 3) Recommended next steps"
```

### 4. Include Relevant Clinical Details
Always include when relevant:
- Age and gender
- Medical history
- Current medications
- Allergies
- Relevant lab values or vital signs
- Duration of symptoms

### 5. Request Evidence-Based Responses
```
"Provide evidence-based recommendations with guidelines cited"
"What does the current literature suggest for this condition?"
```

## Safety and Ethical Considerations

### ⚠️ Important Warnings

1. **NOT FOR CLINICAL USE**
   - These prompts are for educational purposes only
   - Do not use AI-generated responses for actual patient care without professional review
   - AI can make mistakes and may provide incorrect medical information

2. **Verify All Information**
   - Always cross-reference AI responses with authoritative sources
   - Consult medical literature and guidelines
   - Seek expert opinions for complex cases

3. **Privacy**
   - Never include real patient information in prompts
   - Use synthetic or de-identified data only
   - Follow HIPAA and privacy regulations

4. **Bias and Limitations**
   - AI systems may have biases
   - Not all populations are equally represented in training data
   - Cultural and social factors may not be adequately considered

## Assignment Integration

These prompt examples can be used for:
