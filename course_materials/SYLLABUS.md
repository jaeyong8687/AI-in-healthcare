## Welcome Message

Welcome to AI in Healthcare! This is an exciting and rapidly evolving field with enormous potential to improve patient care, advance medical research, and transform healthcare systems. Throughout this course, we'll explore both the promise and the challenges of applying AI to medicine.

This course is designed to be practical and hands-on. You'll work with real healthcare scenarios (using synthetic data), build actual ML models, and grapple with real ethical dilemmas. By the end, you'll have the skills and knowledge to contribute meaningfully to healthcare AI projects.

Remember: the goal is learning, not perfection. Ask questions, try new things, make mistakes, and learn from them. Healthcare AI requires both technical skills and humanistic thinking – we'll develop both.

Looking forward to an excellent semester!
