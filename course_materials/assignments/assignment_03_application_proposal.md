### Part 4: Implementation and Deployment (20 points)
1. **Integration Plan**
   - How will this fit into existing clinical workflows?
   - Technical infrastructure requirements
   - Training requirements for users
   - Change management strategy
   
2. **Regulatory Considerations**
   - FDA classification (if applicable)
   - Required certifications or approvals
   - Compliance requirements (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)
   
3. **Timeline and Milestones**
   - Development phases
   - Key milestones
   - Estimated timeline (realistic assessment)

### Part 5: Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (15 points)
1. **Ethical Considerations**
   - Potential biases and mitigation strategies
   - Fairness across demographic groups
   - Transparency and explainability
   - Patient autonomy and informed consent
   
2. **Legal and Liability Issues**
   - Who is responsible if the AI makes an error?
   - Medical malpractice considerations
   - Data ownership and sharing
   
3. **Social Impact**
   - Effect on healthcare workforce
   - Healthcare access and equity implications
   - Patient trust and acceptance

### Part 6: Business Case (Optional but Recommended) (5 bonus points)
1. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**
   - Development and deployment costs
   - Expected cost savings or revenue
   - Return on investment timeline
   
2. **Market Analysis**
   - Target market size
   - Competition
   - Unique value proposition

## Deliverables
1. **Written Proposal** (10-15 pages)
   - Executive summary (1 page)
   - Main body following structure above
   - References
   - Appendices (UI mockups, data examples, etc.)
   
2. **Presentation Slides** (15-20 slides)
   - Prepare as if presenting to hospital administrators
   - Clear, visual, compelling
   - Include questions for discussion

3. **Optional: Prototype or Demo**
   - Can be a proof-of-concept implementation
   - Mockup with sample data
   - Worth up to 10 bonus points

## Grading Rubric
- Problem identification and literature review: 15%
- Technical solution and approach: 25%
- Data and validation strategy: 20%
- Implementation and regulatory planning: 20%
- Ethical and social considerations: 15%
- Overall quality and presentation: 5%

## Example Topics (You may choose your own)
- AI-powered sepsis prediction in ICU
- Automated medication error detection
- Virtual nursing assistant for post-discharge care
- AI-assisted pathology for cancer diagnosis
- Predictive model for hospital readmissions
- Mental health chatbot for initial screening
- AI-powered drug interaction checker
- Automated clinical note summarization

## Presentation
You will present your proposal in class (15 minutes + 5 minutes Q&A)
- Presentation dates will be scheduled during the last two weeks of class
- Peer feedback will be collected
- Presentation quality affects grade

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit written proposal and slides via course LMS
- File naming: `LastName_FirstName_Assignment3_Proposal`
- Due date: Four weeks from assignment date

## Resources
- FDA guidance on AI/ML-based medical devices
- Course lectures on all topics
- Stanford AI in Healthcare resources
- Healthcare IT News and similar publications
- Conversations with healthcare professionals (strongly encouraged)

## Evaluation Criteria
Your proposal will be evaluated on:
1. **Feasibility**: Is this technically and practically achievable?
2. **Impact**: Would this significantly improve healthcare?
3. **Thoroughness**: Did you consider all relevant aspects?
4. **Innovation**: Is this novel or a significant improvement?
5. **Presentation**: Is it clear, well-organized, and professional?

## Tips for Success
- Start early and consult with instructor for feedback
- Talk to healthcare professionals about real clinical needs
- Be realistic about challenges and limitations
- Support claims with evidence and citations
- Make it compelling - you're "selling" this idea
- Consider both technical and non-technical audiences

## Group Work Option
- You may work in pairs (with instructor approval)
- Clearly document each person's contributions
- Both team members should be prepared to present
